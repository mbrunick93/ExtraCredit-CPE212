# ExtraCredit-CPE212
Write a basic C++ program that will do the following:

- Create a "Student" structure with the following attributes and functions:
- name (string)
- A# (int, leave out the 'A')
- current grade (float)
- letter grade (string)
- CalculateLetterGrade(): sets your letter grade string based on your current grade.
NOTE: There is some freedom here in how the object is done. Struct or class is fine as long as the implementation in your main function works.


inside of Main,
- create a series of at least 5 fictional students with different names and put them into a std::map that uses the student's NAME as the key and the student as a value.
- Then used a loop to go through each student and runs the "CalculateLetterGrade()"
- finally, pick one of your students (Your choice) and use the appropriate key value to find the student within the map and print out their actual letter grade in a cout statement.
